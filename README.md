# Classifying Pulsars using k-NN algorithm

In this group project, I worked with [@trami-dole](https://github.com/trami-dole) and [@MichaelZhang33](https://github.com/MichaelZhang33) to
analyse the pulsars (rotating neutron stars) using R
and implemented the k-NN algorithm to classify pulsars with 97% accuracy
